• Built a web app with Vue.js front end, coupled with Spring Boot back end by RESTful API and HttpClient.

• Developed front end with Vue-Typescript and Apache-ECharts-backed data panel on the merchant end of the app.

• Leveraged Nginx as the load balancer and WebSocket to establish long connect and stand-by features.

• Utilized Spring Cache with Spring Data Redis to handle dynamic contents and frequent database queries.

• Used Mybatis to proxy MySQL database operations; supported Single Sign On with JWT; used PageHelper to
handle pagination; enabled the app to import/export operating statistics in Microsoft Excel with Apache POI.
